--------searchEngine.py-----------------
The simple VSM search engine will ask the user if they want to use a Stemmer, if they want to filter out stopwords, and if they would like to use tf-idf as a term weight. Search Engine will then arrange and group the available documents* to be used. The program then asks the user for a query**. The program will then return Recall and Precision of the search engine.***
To run: python3 searchEngine.py



*Documents have not been added to this repo due to rights and licenses from Glasgow IR Collections. This program can be altered to fit other corpus.
**Queries are predetermined on a document for personal testing purposes. They can be altered to fit user queries.
***Search Engine returns the Recall and Precision for testing purposes but can be altered to return the document names.
